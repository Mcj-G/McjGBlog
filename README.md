# McjGBlog

Welcome! Here is my project - blog engine that I made as my first ever .NET core web application. Going by the rule to make a working product, I wanted it to be a fully functioning app. It still needs a lot of work with some of its functions and details, but my main goal was to make it run and do its job. Because it is my first complex project, it has many mistakes and wrongly used things, and I will try to correct them.

## What is made:
- Creating, editing, and deleting posts (with TinyMCE rich-text editor)
- Creating and deleting comments below posts
- Connecting to a database using Dapper
- SQL database working based on stored procedures
- Editing user name

## What it still needs:
- Refactoring controllers to utilize its features - too many commands are accessed via the HttpPost route
