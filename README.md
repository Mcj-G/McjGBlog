Here is my project - blog engine that I made as my first ever .NET core web application. Going by the rule to make a working product, I wanted it to be a fully functioning app. It still needs a lot of work with some of its functions and details, but my main goal was to make it run and do its job. Because it is my first complex project, it has many mistakes and wrongly used things, and I will try to correct them.

## What is made:
-

## What it still needs:
