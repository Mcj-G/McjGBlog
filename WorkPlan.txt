Blg Ideas:
- user modifications - adding name to existig email addres (on registered user) and storing data in BlogDB
- Obvious - creating and viewing posts and coments
- Saving and loading data from DB
- creating posts only for admin of blog (adding two roles - admin and "normal user")
- make a good layout

Work plan:
- create views for Post and Comment creations (Create, Edit, Delete)
- makeing stored procedures in DB for inserting,loading, modifying and deleting data
